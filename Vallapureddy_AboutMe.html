                <p>Hi there!  I am Nibodh Vallapureddy.  Currently attending Dublin
                High School, I am a freshman who loves to be curious and hardworking.
                My ultimate goal by the time I graduate college is to become a   
                worker in the software field.  There is a lot of work to be put in in order
                to fulfill these dream but I believe I will do this.  In order to be good
                at any job skills that are needed are organization and manamgement skills.
                I have these skills along with knowledge in computer science.  As I 
                become older I will learn more skills essential to I.T growth, thus 
                resulting in me putting a lot more time and effort on growth.  I
                will also seek help from people that have gone through this same
                process to help me successfully achieve my goal.  Pursuing a career in computer software is a great field which I will enjoy and thrive
                in.  My inspiration to become a software worker are my parents.  They too
                are in the software work field and the work they do facinates me.  Through them, 
                I have found out a lot of benefits of have software related occupation.  
                Other careers may not have this luxury, which is why I want to 
                pursue this one.

            Throughout my life, I have faced many matters where certain skills
            were needed in order to be successfull.  These include group projects,
            individual problems, and many more.  Looking back upon these, I have
            noticed certain skills which have repeatedly shown up that have made
            my work better.  Group management is a dominant characteristic that
            I have used many times and am good at using it.  There are many group 
            projects which I was forced to work with teammates that weren't carrying
            their load and continously slacked off.  But, using my skills, I am
            easily able to help my teammates focus and equally contribute to the
            success of the work assigned.  Another skill which is a big part of
            who I am is my tactfulness, which is how I am able to dive into a 
            problem.  Whether in a group or individually, I make sure that I am 
            tackling an issue in the most logical and effective way.  This includes
            not spending too much time on specific needs, when I know that there are
            others that are pending as well.  Even though working on stressful
            tasks is a huge hastle, people find me as a humorous guy.  This humour
            which I occasionally bring up, helps my partners and I effectively 
            manage our given task.  If it weren't for this, a lot of my work wouldn't
            be nearly as good, due to me over working myself.

            Since Eigth Grade I have occured quite a few honors for my excellence
            in a field.  An example of this would be my Civic Action Project, which
            I worked on with four other classmates.  We created a proposal for the
            Dublin Unified School District to add an issue regarding elementary
            kids being able to play competetive sports.  While this proposal didn't 
            make it all the to the District, my history teacher recgonized it as 
            a very innovative idea and gave us really high grades on the project.  
            Another achievement which was placed upon me was when my after-school English
            teacher gave me an honor of being on the dedicated writer.  Over the year
            in a class of ten people we had written so many essays and done various 
            works.  In the beginning, I wasn't the greatest writer and struggled at times.
            But due to the amount of time I spent working to improve my writing, I eventually
            made my writing high school level at just eight grade.  This honor by my teacher
            helped show how my work had paid off.
