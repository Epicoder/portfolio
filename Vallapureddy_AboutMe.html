            <h3><center>Career Goals</center></h3>
                <p><center>By the time I graduate college there are many goals that I want
                to accomplish.  First, I want to join a technological company that
                provides me with a lot of employer benefits.  A company which I
                would really love to join would be Google. In additon, I want to live in a suburban city and live away from all the city noise but at the 
                same time not have to live in a rural area.  Finally, I want to make lots of money
                and donate to heart disease charities.  I plan to accomplish all of the goals
                by working hard and excelling at whatever I do.  To address them more
                specifically, I will take various computer science related courses all throughout
                my life.  By doing this I will be able to make money and donate this as well.

            <h3><center>Work Skills and Personal Qualities</center></h3>    
            <p><center> Throughout my life it has been shown that I posses a lot of
            helpful qualities.  I am a very responsible person, who turns in work
            in on time but also manages my time well.  Times this characteristic has
            been shown is when I work on projects and make sure I do not procrastinate.
            There are also quite a few times which I have aquired work experience.
            These times include when I was in the library helping sort out books, which
            helped with my organization skills.  Also, I have aquired work skills at my
            dad's office where I found out some of the things you need to lead a team.

            <p><center> I have aquired many trophies and honors throughout 
            my life.  Some of these include math competition trophies and basketball
            honors.  In addition, I have mostly stayed academically on track.  I
            never missed the honor roll and I have great grades.  Some things which I
