      <h5><u>Partner Scratch Project</u></h5>
      <h6><strong>August 2018 - September 2018, Computer Science Principles</strong></h6>
      <p> Here is my Scratch game which I worked on with my partner
   Edward Tang.  The purpose of this project was to create a game using the software, Scratch.
   Based on Avengers Infinity War, we decided to make our game based around Thanos.  
   There were a lot of bugs and glitches that we encountered as the charcter would 
   often glitch and not respawn.  There was also an error where the character would fall through the platform.
   Also, due to the huge size this game takes up there were issues regarding loading the game.  We
   spend many hours creating this game and only got to finish half of our projected game.  As a result,
   we changed it to only account for three infinity stones. 
   But in the end we successfully fixed these bugs and it is now a fun game to play.

      <h5><u>Hangman Game</u></h5>
      <h6><strong> January 23 - Feburary 4, Computer Science Principles</strong></h6>
      <p> For this project, my partner and I were tasked to create a Hangman Game using
      the Python language.  We were given more than a week to complete this mini-game which
      was a lot of time.  Initially, we brainstormed ways which we could actually write the code
      and program the game.  After this, we listed ideas which we to make it the them of our game.
      We chose NBA and NFL teams, based upon Keenan and my interests.  After we found this we still
      ran into issues.  We realized that our whole game was under one function and that we needed
      more according to the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2wS9XeKiTj-oFtAlAD7TlYIPcwe61N4JOiKp-eqn0E/edit" 
      target = "blank 7">rubric</a>.  As a result, we split our game to multiple functions to satisfy 
      the rubric.  In the end our game ended up being a huge success and we were proud of the 
      work which we had created.

      <h5> App Inventor Project</h5>
      <h6> September 2018 - October 2018, Computer Science Principles</h6>
      <p> With my partner, Tejvir Virk, he and I created a sharing
      component in which you could share a variety of files.  Some of these
      included; emails, pictures, and drawings.  Overall the app didn't go through
      many bugs like the Scratch one, but we nearly had to redo our whole app due to us messing
      up the code.
