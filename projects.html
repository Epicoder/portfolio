      <h5><u>Partner Scratch Project</u></h5>
      <h6><strong>August 2018 - September 2018, Computer Science Principles</strong></h6>
      <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Here is my Scratch game which I worked on with my partner
   Edward Tang.  The purpose of this project was to create a game using the 
   software, Scratch.Based on Avengers Infinity War, we decided to make our game based around Thanos.  
   This game consists of four levels each getting harder as the progress (for each infinity stone).  
   Creating this, however, was initially a struggle.  
   There were a lot of bugs and glitches that we encountered as the charcter would 
   often glitch and not respawn.  There was also an error where the character 
   would fall through the platform.
   Also, due to the huge size this game takes up there were issues regarding 
   loading the game.  We spent many hours creating this game and only got to 
   finish half of our projected game.  As a result,we changed it to only account 
   for three infinity stones. But in the end we successfully fixed these bugs 
   and it is now a fun game to play.

      <h5><u>Hangman Game</u></h5>
      <h6><strong> January 2019 - Feburary 2019, Computer Science Principles</strong></h6>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  For this project, my partner (Keenan Kalra) and I were tasked to create a Hangman Game using
      the Python language.  We were given more than a week to complete this mini-game which
      was a lot of time.  Initially, we brainstormed ways which we could actually write the code
      and program the game.  After this, we listed ideas which we to make it the them of our game.
      We chose NBA and NFL teams, based upon Keenan and my interests.  After we found this we still
      ran into issues.  We realized that our whole game was under one function and that we needed
      more according to the <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2wS9XeKiTj-oFtAlAD7TlYIPcwe61N4JOiKp-eqn0E/edit" 
      target = "blank 7">rubric</a>.  As a result, we split our game to multiple functions to satisfy 
      the rubric.  We still put it into one function, it is just that we split
      certain parts of our game into different functions to make it easier for us to identify
      what we needed.  In the end our game ended up being a huge success and we were proud of the 
      work which we had created.

      <h5><u>Greenfoot Virus Model Extension</u></h5>
      <h6><strong> Summer 2020, AP CSA</strong></h6>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  For this projects my partners were Shahil Patel and Akshit Agarwal.
          This project was based around Michael Kölling's "Modeling a Virus Epidemic" Greenfoot tutorials which
          are found on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSHcNpGOGOs" target = "blank 7">Youtube</a>.  The task of this project
          was to add onto Kölling's pandemic scenario and create a real life scenario that could occur in the scenario.  We decided to
          include masks for our scenario.  What we did was create different actor that represented a masked person who wouldn't spread
          disease.  This actor would also be unable to receive any transmission because they were covering their face.  Our primary
          reason for including a "masked" actor was to illustrate how masks are essential in controlling the pandemic.  We wanted to spread
          a common message that being the importance of wearing masks.

      <h5><u>Overtime (Unit 1 Project)</u></h5>
      <h6><strong> November 2020 - December 2020, AP CSA</strong></h6>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My partners for this project were Yash Bansal, Tameem Saydi, and Shahil Patel.
          The task for creating this project was to create an interesting, but educational game and we did this
          by incorporating a football element.  Also, we needed to include a random element in our game somehow.
          We did this by working through the Greenfoot GUI to develop 
          and code our game.  The instructions for playing the game are fairly simple as all the user has to do
          is correctly answer the questions and they will gain yards and eventually receive a touchdown (which ends the game).
          For our randomness, we decided to include a random number generator for the amount of yards that the player receives.
          This was the most challenging part of the assignment as we had to account for every single questions and check 
          where the player was on the "field."  Nonetheless, we were able to create a smooth and enjoyable game  due to
          our collaboration.

      <h5><u>NYSE Data Analysis Using Python (Unit 2 Project)</u></h5>
      <h6><strong> January 2021 - February 2021, AP CSA</strong></h6>
      <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My partners for this project were Keenan Kalra and Shahil Patel.
          For this project, we were instructed to create a fun & interesting program
          that used an unique dataset.  In addition, we were allowed to work with any programming language
          of our choice.  Our group eventually ended up working with Python since we 
          were all familiar with the language due to the skills we had learned in Computer Science Principles.
          For our dataset, we decided to choose the Yahoo Finance Library and create three separate programs 
          with it.  Our first program was a stock price searcher, where the user could input any ticker (Stock Symbol)
          of their choice and the daily listings would pop up.  Our second program was where the user could compare
          the cumulative returns of three different stocks and the program would print out a graph showing the differences 
          over time.  Finally, our third program was one where the user would input their desired stock and price and the 
          system would send an email to them once their criteria was met.

      <h5> App Inventor Project</h5>
      <h6> September 2018 - October 2018, Computer Science Principles</h6>
      <p> With my partner, Tejvir Virk, he and I created a sharing
      component in which you could share a variety of files.  Some of these
      included; emails, pictures, and drawings.  Overall the app didn't go through
      many bugs like the Scratch one, but we nearly had to redo our whole app due to us messing
      up the code.
